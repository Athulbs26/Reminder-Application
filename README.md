Create a simple reminder application. A person has to be reminded on the below activities on daily basis in a span of 24 hour:

[Day of the week]

Wake up
Go to gym
Breakfast
Meetings
Lunch
Quick nap
Go to library
Dinner
Go to sleep
The UI should be based on only drop-down lists for selecting the day of the week, choose the time and the choice of activities as given below. Once the time is up the app should play a sound / chime.
